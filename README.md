## The Tasks 

### Weekly task 2

Write a program that calculates somebody's Body Mass Index (BMI). The inputs are the person's height in centimetres and weight in kilograms. The output is their weight divided by their height in metres squared.

$ python bmi.py
Enter weight: 65
Enter height: 180
BMI is 20.06.

### Weekly task 3

Write a program that takes asks a user to input a string and outputs every second letter in reverse order.

$ python secondstring.py
Please enter a sentence: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
.o zletrv pu o wr cu h

### Weekly task 4

Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation. At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one. Have the program end if the current value is one.

$ python collatz.py
Please enter a positive integer: 10
10 5 16 8 4 2 1

### Weekly task 5

Write a program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday. An example of running this program on a Thursday is given below.

$ python weekday.py
Yes, unfortunately today is a weekday.
An example of running it on a Saturday is as follows.

$ python weekday.py
It is the weekend, yay!


### Weekly task 6

Write a program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root. You should create a function called sqrt that does this.

$ python squareroot.py
Please enter a positive number: 14.5
The square root of 14.5 is approx. 3.8.


### Weekly task 7

Write a program that reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains. The program should take the filename from an argument on the command line.

$ python es.py moby-dick.txt
116960

As I am new to programming. Most of the tasks solutions involve a good bit of help from google, I reference sources at the botton of each code, here is a list of frequent places I go for help researching how to do my codes.
